 If there is any doubt in any question pls feel free to ask on the group :))


After doing these question you must have to put those codes onto this repo by pull requests.

If you get any interesting question related to array then make the issue and ask mentors to assign that issue if that isue is assigned to you then start working on it and make a pull request in that time.

On basis of issues and assignment questions we will give you marks and the the one who is gonna make more valis issue and pull requests
will be the coder of week.

Dont try to cheat and copy the answers, it will make you weaker and there is no benefit of this project.
Happy Coding:)
