If there is any doubt in any question pls feel free to ask on the group :))

Everyone must do these question within this week. The deadline is 22nd June 11:59pm.
After doing these question you must have to put those codes onto this repo by pull requests.
Dont try to cheat and copy the answers, it will make you weaker and there is no benefit of this project.
Happy Coding:)
